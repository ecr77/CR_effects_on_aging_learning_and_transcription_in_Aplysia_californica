# CR_effects_on_aging_learning_and_transcription_in_Aplysia_californica

This repository contains all code used for the preparation and analysis of RNA sequencing data for the analysis of transcriptional differnces after learning food is inedible in mature and aged Aplysia californica reared on two diets in the lab of Dr. Lynne Fieber at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. This repository consists of the R project hierarchy and associated files and scripts used during this analysis, with inclusion of BASH scripts used in raw read processing, cleaning, and mapping-quantification steps on UM's LSF CENTOS7 HPC cluster PEGASUS.
